# Wheel_Sensor_Hub
Suspension and tyre data acquisition sub station of a Formula student class 1 car 

One sensor board will be mounted into each upright and will be connected into the CAN 2 network. This board has following capabilities,
- Wheel speed – To detect slippage
- Suspension position – to detect roll and dive and to set suspension settings
-	Tire temperature – For tuning suspension for better lap times
-	Break disk temperature – To detect break fade and adjust break bias<br>

Components are selected as mentioned above. Then the schematic was designed and PCB was then designed with packaging in mind.
